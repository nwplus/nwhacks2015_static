				<h3>Why <em>nw</em>Hacks?</h3>
				<p>As the largest hackathon in the Pacific Northwest region, nwHacks is the place to be to discover new talent as a sponsor, hone your skills as a participant, and make new friends as either. Because of the wide reach of nwHacks, you will be interacting with the top talent from across British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, Alberta and beyond.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question grid-50 tablet-grid-50">
				<h3>What is a "hackathon"?</h3>
				<p>A hackathon is an event where teams of 2-5 people collaborate on an application within the specified time limit (nwHacks is 48 hours long). Prizes are awarded to the most creative, polished and theme-specific projects or "hacks". The winners will be chosen by a panel of judges comprised of top industry professionals.</p>

				<h3>How can I officially sign up?</h3>
				<p>Official registration for nwHacks 2015 isn't open yet, but you can submit your email <a href="#intro">here</a> to get updates as soon as they arrive.</p>

			<div class="question grid-50 tablet-grid-50">
				<h3>What should I bring?</h3>
				<p>nwHacks is a 48hour event, which means that hackers should be prepared to sleep overnight at the venue. Be sure to bring everything you need to stay the night, including a sleeping bag! All food will be provided at event so don't worry about that!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question grid-50 tablet-grid-50">
				<h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
				<p>nwHacks is 100% free for all participants. However registration is strictly limited to <b>highschool and college students only</b>. We will also reimburse your travel expensives as long as they are not flights and are within a 200km radius of the event. We are also setting up buses from Seattle, Portland, and Victoria ( maybe Calgary) so definitely check that out as we get closer to the start date!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question grid-50 tablet-grid-50">
				<h3>Can I work on my previous projects?</h3>
				<p>No, all "hacks" must be built from scratch, although it is ok if you came up with the idea before hand. This rule is strictly adhered to at nwHacks and any team found working on a project that they already started will be automatically disqualified in the event. However this does not apply to any libraries or tools that you have made, so feel free to use libraries and anyother code!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question grid-50 tablet-grid-50">
				<h3>How big can my team be?</h3>
				<p>Teams are usually 2-5 people in size. Teams bigger than 5 people are usually split up into smaller ones, as we've found large teams aren't the best solution for a 48h event. Don't worry if you can't find your team beforehand, staff at the event will help you find other team mates and provide you with many opportunities to find others to help!</p>

			<div class="question grid-50 tablet-grid-50">
				<h3>Does my company have to be based in the Pacific NorthWest to become a sponsor?</h3>
				<p>Definitely not! We welcome sponsors from across the world to help with our event, although it generally helps if you have an office or presence in the region.</p>
